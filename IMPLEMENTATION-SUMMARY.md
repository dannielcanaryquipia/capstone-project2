# ðŸš€ AI Recommendations & Payment Verification Implementation Summary

## âœ… **What's Been Implemented**

### 1. **AI-Based Recommendation System**
- **Service Layer**: `services/recommendation.service.ts`
  - Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for random recommendations
  - Featured products based on order history
  - Category-based recommendations with fallback to random
  - Random recommendations for variety

- **React Hook**: `hooks/useRecommendations.ts`
  - Easy-to-use hook for components
  - Automatic loading of featured and personalized recommendations
  - Error handling and loading states

- **Homepage Integration**: `app/(customer)/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  - Replaced hardcoded recommendations with AI-powered ones
  - "Featured Products" section (top 2 based on order history)
  - "Recommended For You" section (2-4 random products using Fisher-Yates)

### 2. **Payment Verification System**
- **QR Code Service**: `services/qr-code.service.ts`
  - Generate payment QR codes with expiration
  - Order tracking QR codes
  - QR code validation and formatting

- **Payment Components**:
  - `components/payment/QRCodePayment.tsx` - QR code display with timer
  - `components/payment/PaymentProofUpload.tsx` - Proof upload with camera/gallery
  - `components/payment/index.ts` - Export file

### 3. **Database Schema Updates**
- **Migration File**: `database-migration.sql`
  - Added payment verification fields to `payment_transactions`
  - Added payment method and verification fields to `orders`
  - Created `get_featured_products` SQL function
  - Added performance indexes
  - Proper permissions and documentation

### 4. **Dependencies Installed**
- `qrcode` + `@types/qrcode` - QR code generation
- `expo-image-picker` - Camera and gallery access

## ðŸ”„ **Next Steps to Complete**

### 1. **Run Database Migration**
```sql
-- Execute database-migration.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. **Update Product Detail Page**
Add "You May Also Like" section using category-based recommendations:

```typescript
// In product detail page
const { getCategoryRecommendations } = useRecommendations();
const [relatedProducts, setRelatedProducts] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (product) {
    getCategoryRecommendations(product.category_id, product.id, 4)
      .then(setRelatedProducts);
  }
}, [product]);
```

### 3. **Integrate Payment Flow**
- Add QR code payment option to checkout
- Implement proof upload after payment
- Create admin verification interface

### 4. **Test the Implementation**
- Test AI recommendations on homepage
- Test QR code generation
- Test payment proof upload
- Verify database functions work

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features**

### **AI Recommendations**
- **Smart Featured Products**: Based on actual order history
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Fisher-Yates shuffle for variety
- **Category-Based**: Related products with random fallback
- **Performance Optimized**: SQL functions and proper indexing

### **Payment Verification**
- **QR Code Generation**: Secure payment codes with expiration
- **Proof Upload**: Camera and gallery integration
- **Admin Verification**: Database fields for manual review
- **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and visual feedback
