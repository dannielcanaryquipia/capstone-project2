## Database Integration

### Key Tables Utilized
1. **`riders`** - Rider profiles and availability
2. **`delivery_assignments`** - Order-rider assignments
3. **`orders`** - Order management and status
4. **`image_metadata`** - Proof of delivery storage
5. **`notifications`** - Real-time updates

### Enhanced Queries
- Rider statistics calculation
- Available orders filtering
- Assignment status tracking
- Performance metrics

## Payment Method Logic

### COD (Cash on Delivery)
- ✅ Rider can verify payment
- ✅ Payment verification button
- ✅ Mark as delivered with proof
- ✅ Real-time notifications

### GCash (Online Payment)
- ✅ Admin verifies payment first
- ✅ Rider cannot verify payment
- ✅ Automatic assignment after admin verification
- ✅ Delivery without payment verification

## Automatic Assignment Flow

1. **Order Creation** → Customer places order
2. **Admin Processing** → Admin confirms and prepares order
3. **Payment Verification** → Admin verifies GCash payments
4. **Auto-Assignment** → System assigns to available rider
5. **Rider Notification** → Rider receives assignment notification
6. **Delivery Process** → Rider picks up and delivers
7. **Proof Capture** → Rider uploads delivery proof
8. **Completion** → Order marked as delivered

## Real-time Features

### Live Updates
- Order status changes
- Assignment notifications
- Payment verifications
- Delivery completions

### Notifications
- New order assignments
- Payment verification alerts
- Delivery confirmations
- Status updates

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Dashboard Features
- **Statistics Cards**: Delivered orders, earnings, availability
- **Quick Actions**: Navigate to orders, view earnings
- **Real-time Updates**: Live order status
- **Availability Toggle**: Online/offline status

### Orders Management
- **Available Orders**: Accept new assignments
- **My Orders**: Track assigned orders
- **Recent Orders**: View order history
- **Delivered Orders**: Completed deliveries

### Payment Handling
- **COD Verification**: Rider verifies cash payment
- **GCash Handling**: Admin verification required
- **Proof Upload**: Photo capture for delivery proof

## Configuration Options

### Assignment Settings
```typescript
{
  maxOrdersPerRider: 3,
  assignmentRadius: 10, // km
  priorityWeight: {
    distance: 0.4,
    riderAvailability: 0.3,
    orderUrgency: 0.3
  }
}
```

### Notification Settings
- Real-time order updates
- Assignment notifications
- Payment verification alerts
- Delivery confirmations

## Performance Optimizations
